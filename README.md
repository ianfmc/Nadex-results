# LIVEWELL / Nadex-results

This repository is part of the **LIVEWELL** initiative: building an ML-driven workflow for stock price prediction and Nadex binary option recommendations.

## Overview
- **Nadex-results** → stores and processes raw/extracted results data.
- **Nadex-recommendation** → generates daily trading recommendations.
- **Nadex-backtesting** → R&D notebooks for testing strategies and validating ideas.

**This is the Nadex-results repository.**

- All runnable code lives in **`notebooks/`** (Jupyter).
- **Do not commit data or outputs.** Historical/results/reports live in **S3** (see `configs/s3.yaml`).
- Repo configuration lives in **`configs/`** (e.g., `s3.yaml`, `strategy.yaml`, `risk.yaml`, `anonymization.yaml`, `experiment.yaml`).

- Run the notebooks/nadex-recommendation.ipynb file
- Pushes historical pricing information to an S3 bucket in CSV format

## Quickstart
1) Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ianfmc/<repo-name>
cd <repo-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure

- Set AWS creds via env/SSO
- Edit `configs/s3.yaml` (required)
- If this is **Nadex-recommendation**, also edit `configs/strategy.yaml` (and optional `risk.yaml`)

3. Run

- Open a notebook in `notebooks/` (e.g., `01_signals.ipynb`, `02_backtest.ipynb`, or repo-specific notebook)
- Artifacts (CSV/HTML/logs) will be written to **S3** prefixes from `configs/s3.yaml`
